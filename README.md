## Description

This page provides a way for users to enter in any form of text they prefer, and in doing so, the page will return that text to them in the language of Pig Latin.

## Specifications

A small entry bar that is presented to a user, which allows them to enter individual words, which will be treated as a sentence comprised of one long string. For a single word entered in, that word will be analyzed to determine the following:

- The program does nothing to non-alphabetical characters, since they do not contain consonants or vowels.
** Input Example: "3"
** Output Example: "3"

- The program adds "way" to single-letter words beginning with a vowel.

** Input Example: "i"
** Output Example: "iway"

- The program adds "ay" to single-letter words beginning with a consonant.

** Input Example: "bird"
** Output Example: "irdbay"
